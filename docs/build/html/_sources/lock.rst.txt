Locking Nodes
=============

The simulation determining node positions is updated when stepping forwards/backwards through simulation data. This can cause unwanted effects, e.g. some graphs will have a tendancy to slowly rotate when the simulation is repeatedly updated without dragging, showing & hiding, or otherwise perterbing node positions. If you would like to freeze the graph in a particular configuration you can click the "Lock nodes" button to freeze the positions of all the currently shown nodes. Nodes can still be dragged while the lock is applied and will be locked to their new position following the drag. If you unhide nodes that were hidden when the lock was applied then these nodes will not initially be locked, but if you drag them they will lock to their new position.
