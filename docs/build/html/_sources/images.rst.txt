Downloading Images
==================

The image currently displayed by QEsee can be downloaded at any time as an .svg file by clicking "Save SVG".  These images can then be opened with illustrator/inkscape/etc and edited or saved as other filetypes. 

If you use these images in your publications please cite QEsee as DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8307726. If QEsee has been useful in your research but no images from it are used then citation is not required (but is appreciated!).
