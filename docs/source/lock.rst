Locking Nodes
=============

The simulation determining node positions is updated when stepping forwards/backwards through simulation data. This can cause unwanted effects, e.g. some graphs will have a tendancy to slowly rotate when the simulation is repeatedly updated without dragging, showing & hiding, or otherwise perterbing node positions. If you would like to freeze the graph in a particular configuration you can click the "Lock nodes" button to freeze the positions of all the currently shown nodes. This also disables dragging of nodes, and showing/hiding nodes will remove the lock.
